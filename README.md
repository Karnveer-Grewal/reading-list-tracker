# Reading List Tracker

This is a React application that allows a user to keep track of their personal reading list. The application allows one to add and delete books, keep track of the amount of books left in the list and toggle the theme of the tracker. I built this application to practice global state management through the combination of Context API and Reducers.

## Frontend

- HTML

- CSS

- JavaScript

- React (hooks used: useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer)
